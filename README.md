# TMU AI DAO LLC: Tokenizing Decentralized Governance on ICP

Welcome to our Hackathon submission: **TMU AI DAO LLC** — a project demonstrating how a traditional legal entity can be transformed into a **compliant, tokenized Real-World Asset (RWA)** on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**.

## 🚀 What We're Building

We are tokenizing **TMU AI DAO LLC**, an actual registered company, by encoding its **ownership and governance structure** into a **Service Nervous System (SNS)** on ICP. This project bridges the gap between Web2 legal frameworks and Web3 decentralized infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Project Focus

We aim to:

- ✔ **Enable decentralized governance** by using ICP’s SNS to transition from traditional LLC equity to token-based community control.
- ✔ **Enhance transparency and security** via ICP’s tamper-proof ledger, mitigating governance fraud and data manipulation.
- ✔ **Bridge Web2 and Web3** through hybrid compliance—ensuring real-world legality while harnessing blockchain agility and programmability.

## 📦 What’s Inside

Our project includes:

- **SNS Launch Configuration** – A real, deployable SNS for TMU AI DAO LLC
- **Governance Tokenomics** – Designed to align legal ownership with on-chain voting rights
- **Hybrid Compliance Framework** – Explaining how off-chain legal docs match on-chain governance
- **Live Demo / Dashboard** – Interact with the SNS, submit proposals, and vote
- **Investment Deck (linked)** – Outlining the vision, legal design, and monetization model

## 🌉 Why It Matters

Real-world assets like companies, real estate, or funds require compliance, governance, and auditability. ICP’s native DAO tooling and canister infrastructure allows us to:

- Build tamper-resistant, auditable governance processes
- Create real investor confidence through on-chain transparency
- Open liquidity paths for traditional ownership structures

This isn’t just a demo—it’s a working prototype for **real-world DAO-ified corporations**.
